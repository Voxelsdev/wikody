Welcome to Wikody!

A jeapordy-based game using Wikipedia's API.

Here is a link to my running example:

1) What's the name of your project?
2) What problem does it solve?
3) Who has this problem?
4) How does your project solve this problem?
5) What web APIs did it use?
6) What technologies did it use?
7) What was the most valuable piece of Customer feedback you received?
8) What was the biggest challenge you had to overcome?

1) Wikody
2) What to do when you have a bunch of friends over and it's awkward.
3) Millenials (20 - 30 year olds).
4) This project provides a source of entertainment for the people who need it.
5) Wikipedia's API.
6) AJAX, Materialize, jQuery, Python SimpleServer, and of course, eslint.
7) That my project's user flow was very confusing and needed more direction. To me the project made total sense, but that's only because I'm the one who created it.
8) Wikipedia. Wikipedia's API is massive and scarcely documented. I had to come up with a way access information using AJAX without calling to the API, handle 302 status codes, and interpret information from a second request using the information from the first.
