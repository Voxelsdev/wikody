Welcome to Wikody!

A jeapordy-based game using Wikipedia's API.

Here is a link to my running example:

NOTE: In order to use the code you must also have a chrome add-on, found here:

1) What's the name of your project?&nbsp;
2) What problem does it solve?&nbsp;
3) Who has this problem?&nbsp;
4) How does your project solve this problem?&nbsp;
5) What web APIs did it use?&nbsp;
6) What technologies did it use?&nbsp;
7) What was the most valuable piece of Customer feedback you received?&nbsp;
8) What was the biggest challenge you had to overcome?&nbsp;&nbsp;

1) Wikody&nbsp;
2) What to do when you have a bunch of friends over and it's awkward.&nbsp;
3) Millenials (20 - 30 year olds).&nbsp;
4) This project provides a source of entertainment for the people who need it.&nbsp;
5) Wikipedia's API.&nbsp;
6) AJAX, Materialize, jQuery, Python SimpleServer, and of course, eslint.&nbsp;
7) That my project's user flow was very confusing and needed more direction. To me the project made total sense, but that's only because I'm the one who created it.&nbsp;
8) Wikipedia. Wikipedia's API is massive and scarcely documented. I had to come up with a way access information using AJAX without calling to the API, handle 302 status codes, and interpret information from a second request using the information from the first.
